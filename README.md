# Model Training for AI-Generated vs. Real Image Classification

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for training image classification models using Vision Transformer (ViT) and EfficientNetB0 architectures to distinguish between AI-generated images and real images.

## Dataset
- **MS COCO 2017**: A diverse dataset of real images.
- **SyntheticEye AI-Generated Images Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacobheldt/syntheticeue-ai-generated-images-dataset)

## Data Overview
- **Total Images**: 60,802
  - **Real Images**: 30,401
  - **AI-Generated Images**: 30,401

## Model Architectures
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A transformer-based architecture for image classification.
- **EfficientNetB0**: A lightweight and efficient CNN model.

## Training Details
- Models are trained to classify images as either real or AI-generated.
- The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.
